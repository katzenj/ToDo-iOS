# ToDoApp

This app is an extension of Apple's iOS tutorial for building a ToDo app. I've already added a few features inspired by my favorite 
productivity app that I use everyday, TickTick. The buttons and other designs were created myself using Figma. This is still a huge WIP, 
but will continue to develop when I have time outside of school.
